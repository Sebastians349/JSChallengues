Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅 (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 😉

GOOD LUCK 😀
*/

/*
const bill = 430;
const tip = bill <= 300 && bill >= 50 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${bill + tip}`);

Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).
A team ONLY wins if it has at least DOUBLE the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!

1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)".
4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2.
5. Ignore draws this time.

TEST DATA 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
TEST DATA 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27

HINT: To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
HINT: To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B. Apply this to the team's average scores 😉

GOOD LUCK 😀

Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above (you can check out the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100.
2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data below.
3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from the function you created before.
4. BONUS: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, so the bill + tip.

TEST DATA: 125, 555 and 44

HINT: Remember that an array needs a value in each position, and that value can actually be the returned value of a function! So you can just call a function as array values (so don't store the tip values in separate variables first, but right in the new array) 😉

GOOD LUCK 😀

Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter)

1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method.
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark Miller's (23.9)!"

Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!

1. Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values
2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
3. Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!

TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52

HINT: Call calcTip in the loop and use the push method to add values to the tips and totals arrays 😉

4. BONUS: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it:
  4.1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the 'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together
  4.2. To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements)
  4.3. Call the function with the 'totals' array

GOOD LUCK 😀

We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends 😅)!

Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game (below). In this challenge we're gonna work with the data. So here are your tasks:

1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2')
2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players
3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)
4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player names (NOT an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which team is more likely to win, WITHOUT using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.

TEST DATA FOR 6: Use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from game.scored

2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)

Let's build a simple poll app!

A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

Here are your tasks:

1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section 😉

BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?
